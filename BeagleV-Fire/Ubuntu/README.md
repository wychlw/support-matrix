## Installation Steps

### Flashing Gateway Module

**In theory, the Gateway should be pre-flashed and ready to use out of the box.**

### Gateway Upgrade

**The Gateway upgrade can be directly performed in the pre-installed Linux on the board**, refer to [official documentation](https://docs.beagleboard.org/latest/boards/beaglev/fire/demos-and-tutorials/gateware/upgrade-gateware.html)

Upon accessing the Linux command line (via SSH, UART, etc.)
```bash
sudo apt install bbb.io-gateware
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
cd /usr/share/beagleboard/gateware
. ./change-gateware.sh default
```

### Flashing Gateway

Download FlashPro Express from here:
https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/fpga-and-soc-design-tools/programming-and-debug

Once downloaded, proceed with the installation:
```bash
./launch_installer.sh
```

Launch the software:
```bash
/home/$(user)/microchip/Program_Debug_v202X.Y/Program_Debug_Tool/bin/FPExpress
```

Download FlashProExpress.zip, which contains the necessary project files (*.job)

### Image Burning

Connect the computer to the development board using both serial port and USB cables.

Once the DDR Training loading bar appears, interrupt the boot by pressing any key \[a-zA-Z0-9\], then proceed manually:
```bash
>> mmc
>> usbdmsc
```

A new storage device should appear on your computer. Burn the image into it:
```bash
sudo dd if=sdcard.img of=/dev/your/device bs=1M status=progress
```

### System Login

Access the system via serial port.

Default username: `root`
Default password: None

## Expected Results

The system should boot up normally, allowing login via the onboard serial port.

## Actual Results

The system booted up successfully and login via the onboard serial port was achieved.

### Boot Information

Screen recording (from image burning to system login):


```log

```
